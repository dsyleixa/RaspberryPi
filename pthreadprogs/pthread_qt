hi, 
will it be possible to use pthread in a qt program instead  of QThread?
QThread appears to be very overcomplicated always using C++ classes for threading, instead I would prefer to use the simple and straight pthread functions.
E.g., having my form reading and writing pin via widget buttons, I now would like to create a simple extra function for a thread

[code]
volatile bool TASKS_ACTIVE = true;
void* loop(void* data)          //  
{   
    while(TASKS_ACTIVE )  {  //
           digitalWrite(25, HIGH);
           delay(500);
           digitalWrite(25, LOW);
           delay(500);
    }    
    return NULL;  //
}[/code]

would it be allowed then to call

pthread_t thread0;
pthread_create(&thread0, NULL, loop, NULL);

and additionally in a Quit-event (quit button, quit toolbar action) additionally
TASKS_ACTIVE = false;
pthread_join(thread0, NULL);
