git clone https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi
cd WiringPi
./build debian
ls debian-template/*deb

new Repo fork:
Those who were declared dead obviously live longer.

when you already have an old apt-package and want to upgrade by gitclone, then 1st of all better make a clean uninstall of the old one.
