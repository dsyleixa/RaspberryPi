wiringPi is not deprecated, it's just not mainained by G.Henderson any more but still maintained by the community on github.
The last official package was for Pi3B+ on Buster (apt-package), for Pi4 it's on github to download:

https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi 

install:
git clone https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi
cd WiringPi
./build debian
ls debian-template/*deb


when you already have an old apt-package and want to upgrade by gitclone, then 1st better make a clean uninstall of the old one.
